After a long and successful tenure in the Railways Department (in case you were wondering he was the Railway Mminister too) Priyank has finally retired on 28th April 2017.To honor him, his deputy Yash has decided to host a farewell party this Sunday with all of Priyank's friends and collegues attending. Now in his career, Priyank has made many enemies as well and some of them want his last day in office to be his last day alive. His enemies have set a bomb in the banquet hall that will go off at 6:00 PM on 30th April 2017. As his enemies are arrogant, they announce that the bomb can be diffused if the guests orient themselves in a given fashion when the bomb is about to explode.
The banquet hall contains N weight sensors in a straight line. Each of the N guests has a distinct weight in milligrams and is currently standing on one of the sensors. The bomb will explode if there exists more than one Guest Gi such that weight of Gi-1 < Gi > Gi+1 at 6:00 PM. Priyank knows that only two adjacent people can swap positions without setting off the bomb. Given that the bomb will explode soon and each pair of persons swapping positions takes 1 second. What is the minimum Priyank time needs to ensure the bomb will be deactivated and he ends his career with a bang but only figuratively.
